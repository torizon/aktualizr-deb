This section will demonstrate an example of handling device certificates with HSM and was tested using a NitroKey HSM and OpenSC. Instructions will vary depending on your target hardware.

The steps are very similar to those described in xref:generate-devicecert.adoc[Device Certificate Generation] with the main difference being that the device keys are generated on the the HSM. Please make sure that you understood and tested these steps before continuing here.

== Preparing the HSM

You can directly follow link:https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM#initialize-the-device[the steps provided by NitroKey] for this section.

At the end, you should have an empty HSM. The SO-PIN should be kept in a safe place and won't be needed for the rest of this guide. We will however assume that you kept the PIN in a shell variable in the next instructions:

[source,sh]
----
export PIN=YOUR_PIN
----

== Generating the certificate and Uptane keys

To continue, you will have to set up a root certificate, as described in xref:generate-selfsigned-root.adoc[Generate a self-signed root certificate]. If you chose to use an external CA, you will need to send them the certificate signing request (csr file) and obtain the certificate, instead of generating it yourself.

. Install necessary dependencies
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo apt install opensc-pkcs11 openssl
----
+
. Generate an ID for the device, and make a directory for it. This ID should be unique within your fleet, so we recommend using a UUID if you do not already have a scheme of unique identifiers.
+
[source,bash]
----
export device_id=$(uuidgen | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]")
export device_dir=${fleetname}/devices/${device_id}
mkdir -p ${device_dir}
----
. Generate a key on the device with id 02
+
[source,sh]
----
pkcs11-tool -l --pin $PIN --keypairgen --key-type EC:prime256v1 --id 02 --label devicekey
----
+
. Create a configuration file for OpenSSL, named hsm.conf:
+
----
# PKCS11 engine config
openssl_conf = openssl_def

[openssl_def]
engines = engine_section

[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name

[req_distinguished_name]
# empty.

[engine_section]
pkcs11 = pkcs11_section

[pkcs11_section]
engine_id = pkcs11
dynamic_path = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engines-1.1/pkcs11.so
MODULE_PATH = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so
PIN = $PIN
init = 0
----
+
`dynamic_path`, `MODULE_PATH` and `PIN` will need to be changed depending on your system installation and HSM pin.
+
. Generate a Certificate Signing Request using the key:
+
[source,sh]
----
OPENSSL_CONF=./hsm.conf openssl req -new -config "$CWD/certs/client.cnf" -engine pkcs11 -keyform engine -key 4:02 -out "$device_dir/$device_id.csr"
----
+
The `4:02` indicates the `slot:id` to use for the key, you will probably have to change it depending on your setup. In particular, the slot can be found by running `pkcs11-tool -L`:
+
----
Available slots:
Slot 1 (0x4): Nitrokey Nitrokey HSM (010000000000000000000000) 01 00
  token label        : UserPIN (test)
  token manufacturer : www.CardContact.de
  token model        : PKCS#15 emulated
  token flags        : login required, rng, token initialized, PIN initialized
  hardware version   : 24.13
  firmware version   : 2.6
  serial num         : DENK0200509
  pin min/max        : 6/15
----
+
The slot number is the one in hexadecimal between parentheses.
+
. Generate the device certificate and store it in the HSM:
+
[source,sh]
----
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -extfile "${CWD}/certs/client.ext" -in "${device_dir}/${device_id}.csr" \
    -CAkey "${DEVICES_DIR}/ca.key" -CA "${DEVICES_DIR}/ca.crt" -CAcreateserial -out "${device_dir}/client.pem"
----
+
. Save the certificate on the HSM:
+
[source,sh]
----
openssl x509 -in "$device_dir/client.pem" -out "$device_dir/client.der" -outform der
pkcs11-tool -l --pin $PIN --write-object "$device_dir/client.der" --type cert --id 01 --label devicecert
----
+
. Generate an RSA key to sign Uptane metadata
+
[source,sh]
----
pkcs11-tool -l --pin $PIN --keypairgen --key-type RSA:2048 --id 03 --label uptanekey
----
+
At this point, you can verify that your device contains the three objects by running `pkcs11-tool -O`:
+
----
Using slot 1 with a present token (0x4)
Public Key Object; RSA 2048 bits
  label:      uptanekey
  ID:         03
  Usage:      encrypt, verify, wrap

----

== Setting up aktualizr

The following conditions should be fulfilled:

* the HSM token should be accessible on the device
* aktualizr must be compiled with P11 support (refer to xref:enable-device-cred-provisioning.adoc[Enable device-credential provisioning and install device certificates])
* supporting libraries, such as OpenSC must be present on the device
* the device gateway url and TLS root certificate must be obtained from a set of credentials:
+
[source,sh]
----
unzip credentials.zip autoprov.url autoprov_credentials.p12
mv autoprov.url gateway.url
openssl pkcs12 -in autoprov_credentials.p12 -nokeys -cacerts -out ca.crt
----
+
* aktualizr must be configured to use the gateway url, root certificate and HSM. For example:
+
----
[tls]
server_url_path = "/var/sota/import/gateway.url"
cert_source = "pkcs11"
pkey_source = "pkcs11"

[p11]
module = "/usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so"
pass = "1234"
uptane_key_id = "03"
tls_clientcert_id = "01"
tls_pkey_id = "02"

[uptane]
key_source = "pkcs11"

[import]
base_path = "/var/sota/import"
tls_cacert_path = "root.crt"
----
+
Note: on Ubuntu Bionic, the OpenSC pkcs11 module lies in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so`.

== Provisioning the device

If all these steps have been followed, the device will establish a TLS connection to the backend using the HSM and will sign its manifests with the Uptane private key.

== Yocto integration

You can here refer to the instructions in xref:enable-device-cred-provisioning.adoc[Enable device-credential provisioning and install device certificates] but use OpenSC instead of SoftHSM:

----
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " opensc"
SOTA_CLIENT_FEATURES = "hsm"
SOTA_CLIENT_PROV = "aktualizr-device-prov-hsm"
SOTA_DEPLOY_CREDENTIALS = "0"
----

Also, the configuration fragment `/usr/lib/sota/conf.d/20-sota-device-cred-hsm.toml` will also have to be modified, as detailed in the previous section, for example with a `.bbappend`.

Note that for the moment, the gateway url and root certificate will still need to be copied manually to the device.
