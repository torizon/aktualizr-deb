To remove a software version, you need to delete a target in the Targets metadata file.
include::garage-sign-reference.adoc[tags=target-term]

Once you delete a target, you can no longer install it on devices.

*To delete a target:*

include::upload-large-binary.adoc[tags=gs-initialize]

include::upload-large-binary.adoc[tags=gs-pull-targets]

. To delete the target, depending on the type of image, specify the target name and version in one of the following forms:

** For OSTree images, `<name>_<version>`
** For binary images, `<name>-<version>`
+
[source,bash]
----
garage-sign targets delete \
  --filename <name>-<version>
----

include::upload-large-binary.adoc[tags=gs-sign-targets]

include::upload-large-binary.adoc[tags=gs-push-targets]

You can no longer see the deleted software version in your portal software repository.

To learn more about the `garage-sign` commands and options, see its xref:garage-sign-reference.adoc[reference] documentation.
