If you followed the xref:getstarted::get-started.adoc[Get Started Guide], you used a provisioning key that was shared by all devices. In this scenario, the OTA Connect server generates the device credentials for you. This method is fine if you're just evaluating OTA Connect and want to get started quickly. If you want to do some serious testing and eventually move to production, you'll probably want to switch to a more secure provisioning method.

Instead of having OTA Connect generate device certificates for you, you can use your own infrastructure to generate and sign device credentials. We call this method "provisioning with device credentials".

TIP: For a more detailed conceptual overview of the difference between the two types of provisioning, read our xref:client-provisioning-methods.adoc[guide to device provisioning].
