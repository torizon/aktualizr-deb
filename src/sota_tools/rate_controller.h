/**
 * Control the rate of outgoing requests.
 * This receives signals from the network layer when a request finishes of the form (start time, end time, success).
 * It generates controls for the network layer in the form of:
 *    MaxConcurrency - The current estimate of the number of parallel requests that can be opened
 *    Sleep() - The number of seconds to sleep before sending the next request. 0.0 if MaxConcurrency is > 1
 *    Failed() - A boolean indicating that the server is broken, and to report an error up to the user.
 * The congestion control is loosely based on the original TCP AIMD scheme. Better performance might be available by
 * Stealing ideas from the later TCP conjection control algorithms
